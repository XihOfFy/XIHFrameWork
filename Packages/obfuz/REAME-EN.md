## Why Choose Obfuz?

- **Powerful Features**: Provides robust obfuscation and code protection capabilities comparable to commercial tools.
- **Deep Unity Integration**: Optimized for Unity workflows, automatically handling all special cases except reflection (e.g., MonoBehaviour names cannot be obfuscated), working well with zero configuration.
- **Quick Integration**: Simply configure which assemblies to obfuscate and integrate code obfuscation in just three minutes.
- **Stable and Reliable**: Comprehensive automated test projects with over 3000 test cases covering almost all common code scenarios.
- **Hot Update Support**: Supports popular code hot update solutions like HybridCLR and xLua.
- **Agile Development**: Quick response to developer needs, rapid bug fixes, and timely follow-up on the latest changes in Unity and Unite Engine.

## Features

- **Polymorphic DLL Files**: Custom structurally randomized DLL file format with different structures on each release, effectively resisting cracking and tampering.
- **Symbol Obfuscation**: Supports rich configuration rules and incremental obfuscation for flexible and efficient code protection.
- **Constant Obfuscation**: Obfuscates constants like `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `string`, and arrays to prevent reverse engineering.
- **Variable Memory Encryption**: Encrypts variables in memory to enhance runtime security.
- **Evaluation Stack Obfuscation**: Obfuscates variables in the execution stack to increase reverse engineering difficulty.
- **Expression Obfuscation**: Obfuscates most common operations like add and sub.
- **Call Obfuscation**:打乱 function call structures to increase cracking difficulty.
- **Control Flow Obfuscation**: Control flow flattening to disrupt code execution flow, significantly increasing reverse engineering difficulty.
- **Random Encryption Virtual Machine**: Generates randomized virtual machines to effectively resist decompilation and cracking tools.
- **Static and Dynamic Decryption**: Combines static and dynamic decryption to prevent offline static analysis.
- **Obfuscation Polymorphism**: Generates different obfuscated code by configuring different generation keys and random seeds.
- **Garbage Code Generation**: Supports multiple garbage code generation methods to improve App Store and Google Play review pass rates.
- **Code Watermarking**: Embeds traceable watermarks.
- **Deep Unity Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Unity workflows, ready to use with simple configuration.
- **Hot Update Support**: Fully compatible with hot update frameworks like HybridCLR and xLua, ensuring smooth dynamic code updates.
- **DOTS Compatibility**: Compatible with all versions of DOTS without configuration.
